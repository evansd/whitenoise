Using WhiteNoise with Django
============================

.. note:: To use WhiteNoise with a non-Django application see the
   :doc:`generic WSGI documentation <base>`.

This guide walks you through setting up a Django project with WhiteNoise.
In most cases it shouldn't take more than a couple of lines of configuration.

I mention Heroku in a few place as that was the initial use case which prompted me
to create WhiteNoise, but there's nothing Heroku-specific about WhiteNoise and the
instructions below should apply whatever your hosting platform.

1. Make sure *staticfiles* is configured correctly
----------------------------------------------------

If you're familiar with Django you'll know what to do. If you're just getting started
with a new Django project then you'll need add the following to the bottom of your
``settings.py`` file:

.. code-block:: python

   STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

As part of deploying your application you'll need to run ``./manage.py collectstatic`` to
put all your static files into ``STATIC_ROOT``. (If you're running on Heroku then
this is done automatically for you.)

In Django 1.9 and older, make sure you're using the static_ template tag to
refer to your static files. For example:

.. code-block:: django

   {% load static from staticfiles %}
   <img src="{% static "images/hi.jpg" %}" alt="Hi!" />

In Django 1.10 and later, you can use ``{% load static %}`` instead.

.. _static: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#std:templatetag-staticfiles-static


.. _django-middleware:

2. Enable WhiteNoise
--------------------

Edit your ``settings.py`` file and add WhiteNoise to the ``MIDDLEWARE`` list. 
The WhiteNoise middleware should be placed directly after the Django `SecurityMiddleware
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/middleware/#module-django.middleware.security>`_ 
and before all other middleware:

.. code-block:: python

   MIDDLEWARE = [
     'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
     'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
     # ...
   ]

That's it -- WhiteNoise will now serve your static files. However, to get the
best performance you should proceed to step 3 below and enable compression and
caching.


3. Add compression and caching support
--------------------------------------

WhiteNoise comes with a storage backend which automatically takes care of
compressing your files and creating unique names for each version so they can
safely be cached forever. To use it, just add this to your ``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python

   STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'

If you need to compress files outside of the static files storage system you can
use the supplied :ref:`command line utility <cli-utility>`

.. note:: If you are having problems after switching to the WhiteNoise storage
   backend please see the :ref:`troubleshooting guide <storage-troubleshoot>`.

.. _brotli-compression:

Brotli compression
++++++++++++++++++

As well as the common gzip compression format, WhiteNoise supports the newer,
more efficient `brotli`_ format. This helps reduce bandwidth and increase
loading speed. To enable brotli compression you will need the `brotlipy`_
Python package installed, usually by running ``pip install brotlipy`` and
updating your ``requirements.txt`` file.

Brotli is supported by `all major browsers <https://caniuse.com/#feat=brotli>`_ (except IE11). WhiteNoise will only serve brotli data to browsers which request
it so there are no compatibility issues with enabling brotli support.

Also note that browsers will only request brotli data over an HTTPS connection.

.. _brotli: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli
.. _brotlipy: https://brotlipy.readthedocs.io


.. _cdn:

4. Use a Content-Delivery Network
---------------------------------

The above steps will get you decent performance on moderate traffic sites, however
for higher traffic sites, or sites where performance is a concern you should look
at using a CDN.

Because WhiteNoise sends appropriate cache headers with your static content, the CDN
will be able to cache your files and serve them without needing to contact your
application again.

Below are instruction for setting up WhiteNoise with Amazon CloudFront, a popular
choice of CDN. The process for other CDNs should look very similar though.

Instructions for Amazon CloudFront
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Go to CloudFront section of the AWS Web Console, and click "Create
Distribution". Put your application's domain (without the http prefix) in the
"Origin Domain Name" field and leave the rest of the settings as they are.

It might take a few minutes for your distribution to become active. Once it's
ready, copy the distribution domain name into your ``settings.py`` file so it
looks something like this:

.. code-block:: python

   STATIC_HOST = 'https://d4663kmspf1sqa.cloudfront.net' if not DEBUG else ''
   STATIC_URL = STATIC_HOST + '/static/'

Or, even better, you can avoid hardcoding your CDN into your settings by doing something like this:

.. code-block:: python

   STATIC_HOST = os.environ.get('DJANGO_STATIC_HOST', '')
   STATIC_URL = STATIC_HOST + '/static/'

This way you can configure your CDN just by setting an environment variable.
For apps on Heroku, you'd run this command

.. code-block:: bash

   heroku config:set DJANGO_STATIC_HOST=https://d4663kmspf1sqa.cloudfront.net


.. note::

    By default your entire site will be accessible via the CloudFront URL. It's
    possible that this can cause SEO problems if these URLs start showing up in
    search results.  You can restrict CloudFront to only proxy your static
    files by following :ref:`these directions <restricting-cloudfront>`.


.. _runserver-nostatic:

5. Using WhiteNoise in development
----------------------------------

In development Django's ``runserver`` automatically takes over static file
handling. In most cases this is fine, however this means that some of the improvements
that WhiteNoise makes to static file handling won't be available in development and it
opens up the possibility for differences in behaviour between development and production
environments. For this reason it's a good idea to use WhiteNoise in development as well.

You can disable Django's static file handling and allow WhiteNoise to take over
simply by passing the ``--nostatic`` option to the ``runserver`` command, but
you need to remember to add this option every time you call ``runserver``. An
easier way is to edit your ``settings.py`` file and add
``whitenoise.runserver_nostatic`` to the top of your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list:

.. code-block:: python

   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       'whitenoise.runserver_nostatic',
       'django.contrib.staticfiles',
       # ...
   ]

.. note::

    In older versions of WhiteNoise (below v4.0) it was not possible to use
    ``runserver_nostatic`` with  `Channels`_ as Channels provides its own
    implementation of runserver. Newer versions of WhiteNoise do not have this
    problem and will work with Channels or any other third-party app that
    provides its own implementation of runserver.

.. _Channels: https://channels.readthedocs.io/


.. _index-files-django:

6. Index Files
--------------

When the :any:`WHITENOISE_INDEX_FILE` option is enabled:

* Visiting ``/example/`` will serve the file at ``/example/index.html``
* Visiting ``/example`` will redirect (302) to ``/example/``
* Visiting ``/example/index.html`` will redirect (302) to ``/example/``

If you want to something other than ``index.html`` as the index file, then you
can also set this option to an alternative filename.


Available Settings
------------------

The WhiteNoiseMiddlware class takes all the same configuration options as the
WhiteNoise base class, but rather than accepting keyword arguments to its
constructor it uses Django settings. The setting names are just the keyword
arguments upper-cased with a 'WHITENOISE\_' prefix.


.. attribute:: WHITENOISE_ROOT

    :default: ``None``

    Absolute path to a directory of files which will be served at the root of
    your application (ignored if not set).

    Don't use this for the bulk of your static files because you won't benefit
    from cache versioning, but it can be convenient for files like
    ``robots.txt`` or ``favicon.ico`` which you want to serve at a specific
    URL.

.. attribute:: WHITENOISE_AUTOREFRESH

    :default: ``settings.DEBUG``

    Recheck the filesystem to see if any files have changed before responding.
    This is designed to be used in development where it can be convenient to
    pick up changes to static files without restarting the server. For both
    performance and security reasons, this setting should not be used in
    production.

.. attribute:: WHITENOISE_USE_FINDERS

    :default: ``settings.DEBUG``

    Instead of only picking up files collected into ``STATIC_ROOT``, find and
    serve files in their original directories using Django's "finders" API.
    This is useful in development where it matches the behaviour of the old
    ``runserver`` command. It's also possible to use this setting in
    production, avoiding the need to run the ``collectstatic`` command during
    the build, so long as you do not wish to use any of the caching and
    compression features provided by the storage backends.

.. attribute:: WHITENOISE_MAX_AGE

    :default: ``60 if not settings.DEBUG else 0``

    Time (in seconds) for which browsers and proxies should cache **non-versioned** files.

    Versioned files (i.e. files which have been given a unique name like *base.a4ef2389.css* by
    including a hash of their contents in the name) are detected automatically and set to be
    cached forever.

    The default is chosen to be short enough not to cause problems with stale versions but
    long enough that, if you're running WhiteNoise behind a CDN, the CDN will still take
    the majority of the strain during times of heavy load.


.. attribute:: WHITENOISE_INDEX_FILE

    :default: ``False``

    If ``True`` enable :ref:`index file serving <index-files-django>`. If set to a non-empty
    string, enable index files and use that string as the index file name.


.. attribute:: WHITENOISE_MIMETYPES

    :default: ``None``

    A dictionary mapping file extensions (lowercase) to the mimetype for that
    extension. For example: ::

        {'.foo': 'application/x-foo'}

    Note that WhiteNoise ships with its own default set of mimetypes and does
    not use the system-supplied ones (e.g. ``/etc/mime.types``). This ensures
    that it behaves consistently regardless of the environment in which it's
    run.  View the defaults in the :file:`media_types.py
    <whitenoise/media_types.py>` file.

    In addition to file extensions, mimetypes can be specified by supplying the entire
    filename, for example: ::

        {'some-special-file': 'application/x-custom-type'}


.. attribute:: WHITENOISE_CHARSET

    :default: ``settings.FILE_CHARSET`` (utf-8)

    Charset to add as part of the ``Content-Type`` header for all files whose
    mimetype allows a charset.


.. attribute:: WHITENOISE_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS

    :default: ``True``

    Toggles whether to send an ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`` header for all
    static files.

    This allows cross-origin requests for static files which means your static files
    will continue to work as expected even if they are served via a CDN and therefore
    on a different domain. Without this your static files will *mostly* work, but you
    may have problems with fonts loading in Firefox, or accessing images in canvas
    elements, or other mysterious things.

    The W3C `explicitly state`__ that this behaviour is safe for publicly
    accessible files.

.. __: https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#security


.. attribute:: WHITENOISE_SKIP_COMPRESS_EXTENSIONS

    :default: ``('jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif', 'webp','zip', 'gz', 'tgz', 'bz2', 'tbz', 'xz', 'br', swf', 'flv', 'woff')``

    File extensions to skip when compressing.

    Because the compression process will only create compressed files where
    this results in an actual size saving, it would be safe to leave this list
    empty and attempt to compress all files. However, for files which we're
    confident won't benefit from compression, it speeds up the process if we
    just skip over them.


.. attribute:: WHITENOISE_ADD_HEADERS_FUNCTION

    :default: ``None``

    Reference to a function which is passed the headers object for each static file,
    allowing it to modify them.

    For example: ::

        def force_download_pdfs(headers, path, url):
            if path.endswith('.pdf'):
                headers['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment'

        WHITENOISE_ADD_HEADERS_FUNCTION = force_download_pdfs

    The function is passed:

    headers
      A `wsgiref.headers`__ instance (which you can treat just as a dict) containing
      the headers for the current file

    path
      The absolute path to the local file

    url
      The host-relative URL of the file e.g. ``/static/styles/app.css``

    The function should not return anything; changes should be made by modifying the
    headers dictionary directly.

.. __: https://docs.python.org/3/library/wsgiref.html#module-wsgiref.headers


.. attribute:: WHITENOISE_IMMUTABLE_FILE_TEST

    :default: See :file:`immutable_file_test <whitenoise/middleware.py#L121>` in source

    Reference to a function which is passed the path and URL for each static
    file and should return whether that file is immutable, i.e. guaranteed not
    to change, and so can be safely cached forever. The default is designed to
    work with Django's ManifestStaticFilesStorage backend, and any
    derivatives of that, so you should only need to change this if you are
    using a different system for versioning your static files.

    Example: ::

        def immutable_file_test(path, url):
            # Match filename with 12 hex digits before the extension
            # e.g. app.db8f2edc0c8a.js
            return re.match(r'^.+\.[0-9a-f]{12}\..+$', url)

        WHITENOISE_IMMUTABLE_FILE_TEST = immutable_file_test

    The function is passed:

    path
      The absolute path to the local file

    url
      The host-relative URL of the file e.g. ``/static/styles/app.css``


.. attribute:: WHITENOISE_STATIC_PREFIX

    :default: Path component of ``settings.STATIC_URL`` (with
              ``settings.FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME`` removed if set)

    The URL prefix under which static files will be served.

    Usually this can be determined automatically by using the path component of
    ``STATIC_URL``. So if ``STATIC_URL`` is ``https://example.com/static/``
    then ``WHITENOISE_STATIC_PREFIX`` will be ``/static/``.

    If your application is not running at the root of the domain and
    ``FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME`` is set then this value will be removed from the
    ``STATIC_URL`` path first to give the correct prefix.

    If your deployment is more complicated than this (for instance, if you are
    using a CDN which is doing path rewriting) then you may need to configure
    this value directly.


.. attribute:: WHITENOISE_KEEP_ONLY_HASHED_FILES

    :default: ``False``

    Stores only files with hashed names in ``STATIC_ROOT``.

    By default, Django's hashed static files system creates two copies of each
    file in ``STATIC_ROOT``: one using the original name, e.g. ``app.js``, and
    one using the hashed name, e.g. ``app.db8f2edc0c8a.js``. If WhiteNoise's
    compression backend is being used this will create another two copies of
    each of these files (using Gzip and Brotli compression) resulting in six
    output files for each input file.

    In some deployment scenarios it can be important to reduce the size of the
    build artifact as much as possible.  This setting removes the "un-hashed"
    version of the file (which should be not be referenced in any case) which
    should reduce the space required for static files by half.

    Note, this setting is only effective if the WhiteNoise storage backend is
    being used.


Additional Notes
----------------


Django Compressor
+++++++++++++++++

For performance and security reasons WhiteNoise does not check for new
files after startup (unless using Django `DEBUG` mode). As such, all static
files must be generated in advance. If you're using Django Compressor, this
can be performed using its `offline compression`_ feature.

.. _offline compression: https://django-compressor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/#offline-compression

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Serving Media Files
+++++++++++++++++++

WhiteNoise is not suitable for serving user-uploaded "media" files. For one
thing, as described above, it only checks for static files at startup and so
files added after the app starts won't be seen. More importantly though,
serving user-uploaded files from the same domain as your main application is a
security risk (this `blog post`_ from Google security describes the problem
well). And in addition to that, using local disk to store and serve your user
media makes it harder to scale your application across multiple machines.

For all these reasons, it's much better to store files on a separate dedicated
storage service and serve them to users from there. The `django-storages`_
library provides many options e.g. Amazon S3, Azure Storage, and Rackspace
CloudFiles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


.. _storage-troubleshoot:

Troubleshooting the WhiteNoise Storage backend
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you're having problems with the WhiteNoise storage backend, the chances are
they're due to the underlying Django storage engine. This is because WhiteNoise
only adds a thin wrapper around Django's storage to add compression support,
and because the compression code is very simple it generally doesn't cause
problems.

The most common issue is that there are CSS files which reference other files
(usually images or fonts) which don't exist at that specified path. When Django
attempts to rewrite these references it looks for the corresponding file and
throws an error if it can't find it.

To test whether the problems are due to WhiteNoise or not, try swapping the WhiteNoise
storage backend for the Django one:

.. code-block:: python

   STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.ManifestStaticFilesStorage'

If the problems persist then your issue is with Django itself (try the docs_ or
the `mailing list`_). If the problem only occurs with WhiteNoise then raise a
ticket on the `issue tracker`_.

.. _docs: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/contrib/staticfiles/
.. _mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/django-users

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


.. _restricting-cloudfront:

Restricting CloudFront to static files
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The instructions for setting up CloudFront given above will result in the
entire site being accessible via the CloudFront URL. It's possible that this
can cause SEO problems if these URLs start showing up in search results.  You
can restrict CloudFront to only proxy your static files by following these
directions:


 1. Go to your newly created distribution and click "*Distribution Settings*", then
    the "*Behaviors*" tab, then "*Create Behavior*". Put ``static/*`` into the path pattern and
    click "*Create*" to save.

 2. Now select the ``Default (*)`` behaviour and click "*Edit*". Set "*Restrict Viewer Access*"
    to "*Yes*" and then click "*Yes, Edit*" to save.

 3. Check that the ``static/*`` pattern is first on the list, and the default one is second.
    This will ensure that requests for static files are passed through but all others are blocked.


Using other storage backends
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

WhiteNoise will only work with storage backends that stores their files on the
local filesystem in ``STATIC_ROOT``. It will not work with backends that store
files remotely, for instance on Amazon S3.


WhiteNoise makes my tests run slow!
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

WhiteNoise is designed to do as much work as possible upfront when the
application starts so that it can serve files as efficiently as possible while
the application is running. This makes sense for long-running production
processes, but you might find that the added startup time is a problem during
test runs when application instances are frequently being created and
destroyed.

The simplest way to fix this is to make sure that during testing the
``WHITENOISE_AUTOREFRESH`` setting is set to ``True``. (By default it is
``True`` when ``DEBUG`` is enabled and ``False`` otherwise.) This stops
WhiteNoise from scanning your static files on start up but other than that its
behaviour should be exactly the same.

It is also worth making sure you don't have unnecessary files in your
``STATIC_ROOT`` directory.  In particular, be careful not to include a
``node_modules`` directory which can contain a very large number of files and
significantly slow down your application startup. If you need to include
specific files from ``node_modules`` then you can create symlinks from within
your static directory to just the files you need.


Using WhiteNoise with Webpack / Browserify / $LATEST_JS_THING
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A simple technique for integrating any frontend build system with Django is to
use a directory layout like this:

.. code-block:: sh

   ./static_src
           ↓
     $ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack
           ↓
   ./static_build
           ↓
     $ ./manage.py collectstatic
           ↓
   ./static_root

Here ``static_src`` contains all the source files (JS, CSS, etc) for your
project. Your build tool (which can be Webpack, Browserify or whatever you
choose) then processes these files and writes the output into ``static_build``.

The path to the ``static_build`` directory is added to ``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python

   STATICFILES_DIRS = [
       os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static_build')
   ]

This means that Django can find the processed files, but doesn't need to know anything
about the tool which produced them.

The final ``manage.py collectstatic`` step writes "hash-versioned" and
compressed copies of the static files into ``static_root`` ready for
production.

Note, both the ``static_build`` and ``static_root`` directories should be
excluded from version control (e.g. through ``.gitignore``) and only the
``static_src`` directory should be checked in.


Deploying an application which is not at the root of the domain
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Sometimes Django apps are deployed at a particular prefix (or "subdirectory")
on a domain e.g. http://example.com/my-app/ rather than just http://example.com.

In this case you would normally use Django's `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#force-script-name>`_
setting to tell the application where it is located. You would also need to
ensure that ``STATIC_URL`` uses the correct prefix as well. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME = '/my-app'
   STATIC_URL = FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME + '/static/'

If you have set these two values then WhiteNoise will automatically configure
itself correctly. If you are doing something more complex you may need to set
:any:`WHITENOISE_STATIC_PREFIX` explicitly yourself.
